Mouselog.js
====

Mouselog.js is the client-side agent for Microsoft's [Mouselog](https://github.com/microsoft/mouselog), a user behavior monitoring platform for websites.

## CDN
Embed Mouselog in your HTML files:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mouselog@latest/build/mouselog.js"></script>
<script>
    var agent = mouselog.init();
    agent.run({
        uploadEndpoint: "Your_Server_Url",
        websiteId: "Your_Website_Id",
        endpointType: "absolute"
    });
</script>
```
You can also include mouselog dynamically in Javascript:
```Javascript
(function() {
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mouselog@latest/build/mouselog.js";
    script.onload = function() {
        var agent = mouselog.init();
        agent.run({
            uploadEndpoint: "Your_Server_Url",
            websiteId: "Your_Website_Id",
            endpointType: "absolute"
        });
    }
    var t = document.getElementsByTagName("script");
    var s = t.length > 0 ? t[0].parentNode : document.body;
    s.appendChild(script, s);
})();
```

###
To achieve high compatability for IE9, you should refer to [promise-polyfill](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill) before refering Mouselog agent.

## Build Manually
You can also bundle Mouselog.js manually via
```
npm i
npm run build
```
This will generate the bundled scripts in `./build`.

## NPM
Install Mouselog.js via
```
npm i mouselog --save
```

Then run Mouselog and it will automatically collect all you want.
```Javascript
// const { Mouselog } = require('mouselog');
import Mouselong from 'mouselog';
let agent = new Mouselog();
agent.run({
    uploadEndpoint: "Your_Server_Url",
    websiteId: "Your_Website_Id",
    endpointType: "absolute"
});
```
You can also deactivate Mouselog by calling `agent.stop()`.


# Configuration

## Username

You can set username by assigning the username to `window.mouselogUserId`.
```js
window.mouselogUserId = "Username"ï¼›
```
Mouselog agent will automatically load it when uploading the data to the server.

## Other parameters
```js
{
    // Type: string
    // Endpoint Url, required
    uploadEndpoint: "your_server_url",

    // Type: string
    // Website ID
    websiteId: "unknown",

    // Endpoint type, "absolute" or "relative"
    endpointType: "absolute",

    // Upload mode, "mixed", "periodic" or "event-triggered"
    // "periodic": upload data in every period.
    // "event-triggered": upload data when a number of interaction data is captured
    // "mixed": the mixture of the previous two upload mode 
    uploadMode: "mixed",

    // Type: number
    // If `uploadMode` == "periodic", data will be uploaded every `uploadPeriod` ms.
    // If no data are collected in a period, no data will be uploaded
    uploadPeriod: 5000,

    // Type: number
    // If `uploadMode` == "event-triggered"
    // The website interaction data will be uploaded when every `frequency` events are captured.
    frequency: 50,

    // Maximum size of a single package
    sizeLimit = 65535,

    // Type: bool
    // Use GET method to upload data? (stringified data will be embedded in URI)
    enableGet: false,

    // Type: HTML DOM Element
    // Agent only listens and captures events in `config.scope`
    scope: window.document
}
